# AircraftSimulationControl

This repository contains the simulation model of RCAM (research civil aircraft model). It is done for personal interest to self-teach how to develop a simulation model of an aircraft.
The reference is contained in the MATLAB file.

All methodologies of simulation model files are taken from YouTube video (Dr. Christopher Lum's video). However, control methodologies that have been developed are taken from various sources such as books, journals, etc.

Further adjustments of the aircraft simulation will be made in the near future.
